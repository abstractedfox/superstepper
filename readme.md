In-progress companion app for [drs-chart-tools](https://github.com/abstractedfox/drs-chart-tools)

At the time of this writing:
* Charts play back in sync (BPM must be entered manually for now)
* Most note types render. Holds with swipes will have the right shape but the actual 'swipe' is not distinguished visually yet
